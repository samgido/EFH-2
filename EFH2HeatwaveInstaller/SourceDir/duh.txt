/* DO NOT REMOVE THE BLANK LINE ABOVE THIS LINE */

This file contains a list of dimensionless unit hydrographs that may be
selected by the user. The corresponding .duh files should exist in the
common application data folder:

C:\ProgramData\USDA\Shared Engineering Data\EFH2\DimensionlessUnitHydrographs\

The default is to use the standard distribution when left blank or <standard>
is selected. All others correspond to their respective .duh file; e.g.,
delmarva is stored in delmarva.duh, etc.

Users can add or remove dimensionless user hydrograph files as needed. 
The list above should be edited to reflect the change.

Note that a blank line is used to delimit the end of the list above.
