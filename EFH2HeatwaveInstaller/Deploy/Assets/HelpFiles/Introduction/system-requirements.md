### Estimating Runoff and Peak Discharge

The EFH-2 software should install and operate on computers with Windows® 10 operating systems.  Less than 5 MB of hard drive space is required for installing this software.

The program window will display best if maximized with a screen resolution of 1076 x 768 pixels or higher.  Lower resolutions or reduced screen sizes may cut off some of the label information, particularly on the Runoff Curve Number (RCN) tab.
