## Data Entry

#### **General Data Entry** 
Typically the user would begin on the ‘Basic data’ tab in the Client field. The user progresses through the entry fields by pressing the Enter key or Tab key upon completion of data entry in that field. To traverse to the previous field, press Shift-Tab. If a mistake is made during entry, pressing the ESC key will return the field to its value upon entering the field. Calculated fields will automatically be updated when sufficient valid data has been entered to make the calculation. Warning messages appear when the user enters invalid data.

After the fields on the ‘Basic data’ are completed, click the ‘**Rainfall/Discharge data**’ tab to continue entering and view results. See help screens [State/County](Data Entry\state-county.md), [Curve Number/ Drainage Area](Data Entry\curve-number-drainage-area-fields.md) and [Time of Concentration](Data Entry\time-of-concentration.md) for more detail about entry rules. The following table details the function of various keys. Note that the grid cells on the RCN screen may operate slightly differently.
