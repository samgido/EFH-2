## State / County Fields

#### **State**

The state field will accept only two characters representing the State postal code. The state can be selected from the dropdown list (Rainfall_Data.xlsx database).Â  Attempting to leave this field without two characters or selected from the dropdown list will results in an error-warning message. Acknowledging the message by pressing OK returns the user to the State field for correction. Pressing cancel will clear the field and move the cursor to the next field, as user directed.

#### **County**

This field is intended to be entered after the State field is completed. The counties from the rainfall file for that state (Rainfall_Data.xlsx database) will be read into the dropdown list for the field. The user should select from the list to be assured that the associated precipitation data will be read from the file. The county name must match one from the file. Beginning to type the first few letters of the county name will scroll the dropdown list to any matching value. The dropdown list must be displayed to select match. Pressing enter will accept that match.
