## EFH-2

### Estimating Runoff Volume and Peak Discharge

EFH-2 is a computer program used to predict runoff volume and peak discharge from small, single subarea watersheds in the design of on-farm conservation practices.  The EFH-2 software implements the procedures describes in the NEH 630 – National Engineering Handbook, “Hydrology” to compute full hydrographs and report the peak discharge. EFH-2 uses the TR-20 computational  engine common to both the WinTR-20, “Project Formulation Hydrology” and WinTR-55 “Small Watershed Hydrology” computer programs.  More details about the concepts of this software may be found in this handbook.
