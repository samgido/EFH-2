Use this command to save the current data to a file for later retrieval and editing. An EFM extension will be added to the file name, identifying the file as EFH2/EFM2 data.

#### **Print Ctrl+P**
![](file-print.png)

Use this command to print the current data to the default Windows printer. After selecting the command, a dialog window appears where the user can change the selected printer and select desired printer parameters. Page one with basic data and discharge information will always print. Page two with Runoff Curve Number calculations will only print if this data exists.

Printing to a file is possible during this operation. However, with most printer drivers many unwanted characters will be embedded in the printed file. By choosing a generic text printer and selecting the "print to file" check box, an acceptable facsimile of the printout can be sent to a text file. This driver will need to be installed on the computer to take advantage of this option.

#### **Exit**

Use this command to terminate the application.
