                The method applies when: 
	                - Watershed is accurately represented by a single runoff curve number between 40 and 98.
                	- Watershed area is between 1 and 2000 acres.
	                - Watershed hydraulic length is between 200 and 26000 feet.
	                - Average watershed slope is between 0.5 and 64 percent.
	                - No valley or reservoir routing is required.
	                - Maximum rainfall is between 0 and 26 inches.
	                - Urban land use within the watershed does not exceed 10%.
